# VRto3D

OpenVR Driver that can render in SbS or TaB 3D.
Currently targeting OpenVR 2.5.1.
Windows-only solution currently, but there are other solutions on Linux like MonadoVR.


## Compatible 3D Displays
- 3D TVs - work great if you can find one
- 3D Projectors - work great, but need more space and may be expensive
- AR Glasses (Rokid, Xreal, Viture) - work great, relatively inexpensive
- Lume Pad - works great, a bit more expensive, requires Sunshine/Gamestream + Moonlight
- 3D Vision hardware (only RTX 20x or older) - will have game compatibility issues, hardware is hard to find

## Base Installation

- A multi-display configuration setup (see notes) will be the most compatible, but single displays can be used. Some mods or games may not work with a single display
- Install SteamVR
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/oneup03/VRto3D/releases/latest) and copy the `vrto3d` folder to your `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers` folder
- Edit the `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\vrto3d\resources\settings\default.vrsettings` as needed
	- Set your window resolution to match your fullscreen resolution (i.e. 3840x1080 for Full-SbS or 1920x1080 for Half-SbS)
	- Set your render resolution per eye to what you want. Can save some performance by reducing this if you're running a half-size 3D format
- Run SteamVR at least once to verify that you see a Headset window. This is usually not needed before running games.
	- The Headset window must be on your primary 3D display
- Try launching a VR game
- Multi-Display setups:
	- Drag everything besides the headset view to your second display
	- Make the headset window in focus on your primary display
	- Make the game's window in focus on your second display for control input to work
- Single Display setup:
	- Make the headset window in focus on your display
	- Press `Ctrl+F8` to toggle locking the headset window to the foreground
	- Use `Alt+Tab` to switch to the game window
	- If the headset window went completely black, this game isn't compatible in single display mode
	- To quit, `Alt+Tab` to the SteamVR Status window and close it with `Alt+F4`
- Adjust Depth with `Ctrl+F3` and `Ctrl+F4`
- Adjust Convergence with `Ctrl+F5` and `Ctrl+F6`
- Save all Depth & Convergence settings with `Ctrl+F7`


## Interlaced, Checkerboard, and Anaglyph Installation

- Complete the Base Installation section
- Optionally set `tab_enable` to true in `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\vrto3d\resources\settings\default.vrsettings` if you prefer to lose half vertical resolution instead of half horizontal resolution
	- If using interlaced mode, you want SbS for Column Interlaced and TaB for Row Interlaced
- Download the latest [ReShade](https://reshade.me/#download) with full add-on support
- Run the ReShade installer
	- Browse to to your `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\bin\win64` folder
	- Select `vrserver.exe`
	- Select DirectX 11
	- Click `Uncheck All` and click Next, Next, Finish
- Download [3DToElse.fx](https://github.com/BlueSkyDefender/Depth3D/tree/master/Other%20%20Shaders) and save it to `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\bin\win64\reshade-shaders\Shaders`
- Run SteamVR
- Press `Home` to open ReShade and click `Skip Tutorial`
- Select `To_Else` in the menu to enable 3DToElse
- Change 3DToElse settings:
	- Set `Stereoscopic Mode Input` to `Side by Side` (or `Top and Bottom` if you set `tab_enable` above)
	- Set `3D Display Mode` to the type needed for your display (even anaglyph)
	- `Eye Swap` can be toggled if needed
	- Don't touch `Perspective Slider`
- Once configuration is complete, you can run everything the same way as the Base Installation


## 3DVision Installation

- This will be the worst experience due to the finicky nature of 3DVision drivers. It is highly recommended to buy a different 3D Display to use moving forward. AR glasses (Rokid, Xreal, Viture) all work and provide a better experience than 3DVision ever did. AR glasses will need a [compatible adapter](https://air.msmithdev.com/adapters/) if you don't have a USBC port on your computer with DP out.
- Only Driver v425.31 or 452.06 may work, so only RTX20 series or older
	- Some DX12 games are not compatible with these old drivers (crashes)
	- Having 3DVision enabled will crash DX12 games
	- Make sure your game runs on old drivers with 3D disabled before attempting to get it working with VRto3D
	- If you get a black screen while trying to run SteamVR + 3DVision, you may have to hard reset
	- Only Multi-Display setups will work due to 3DVision needing to always be fullscreen to activate
	- If you run into one-eye issues or other weirdness, try using DDU and reinstalling the driver
- Complete the Base Installation section
- If you want full resolution per eye, enable DSR 4x in Nvidia Control Panel -> Manage 3D Settings
- Modify the `window_width` and `window_height` in `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\vrto3d\resources\settings\default.vrsettings` to match your fullscreen resolution
	- This should match your DSR 4x resolution if you're using DSR
- Modify the `render_width` and `render_height` to be the resolution you want per eye, can be lower or higher than the window setting
	- Recommended to set this to your monitors normal non-DSR resolution to avoid the performance hit
- Download Bo3b's [SbS to 3DVision](https://bo3b.s3.amazonaws.com/SD3D_eng.7z) tool and extract the contents to your `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\bin\win64` folder
- Enable 3D and Global hack. [3D Fix Manager](https://helixmod.blogspot.com/2017/05/3d-fix-manager.html) can do this
- Run SteamVR from Steam - you will have to do this before running any game with a 3DVision setup
- This configuration step should only need to be done once:
	- Press `Home` to bring up the ReShade menu and select the SBS `SBS_to_Double.fx` shader and click `Reload`
	- The Headset window has to be in focus for 3DVision to trigger - try clicking on it
	- May need to press `Ctrl+T` to get 3D to trigger
	- If it's still not working, try closing SteamVR and trying again
	- If 3D flickers on and off, try toggling 3D in Nvidia Control Panel
- Disable 3D from Nvidia Control Panel (This may not be needed if you are running a VR-native game)
- Run your Game
- Move Game window to your second display
- If needed, inject VR mod
- Bring SteamVR Headset window into focus on main display
	- If you get complaints about running in a non-stereo mode, Enable 3D in Nvidia Control Panel again
- Switch back to the game window on second display and hopefully input works and 3D is still displaying
	- Changing the game window to windowed mode may help to make sure it doesn't trigger a go-fullscreen event and thus disable 3D on your 3D display


## Notes

- If you have a VR headset and run into issues with this driver, here's some things to try:
	- Disconnect VR headset from computer
	- [Clean SteamVR Install](https://steamcommunity.com/app/250820/discussions/2/1640917625015598552/)
	- [Set SteamVR as OpenXR Runtime](https://www.vive.com/us/support/vs/category_howto/trouble-with-openxr-titles.html)
- This project is primarily targeted for VR mods of flatscreen games, not full VR games. As such, there is only headset pitch & yaw emulation and no VR controller emulation
- Several VR controller only games can be made to work by using [Driver4VR](https://www.driver4vr.com/), a paid SteamVR Vive controller emulator. Games with mainly pointer controls work ok. Games with a lot of interaction/movement don't work well.
- Check the [Compatibility List](https://github.com/oneup03/VRto3D/wiki/Compatibility-List) to see if a game has been tested
- You will need a multi-display setup in extended mode
- The primary display will be where the "Headset" window is located and should be 3D capable
- The secondary display will need to have the game's main window in focus for control input from your mouse/keyboard/controller to work
- Here are some example configurations that are confirmed to work:
	- A single display connected to your computer twice in extended mode - switch between the inputs on the monitor as needed to move windows around
	- Multiple displays connected in extended mode - easier to move things around and manage
	- A virtual monitor will work, but will prove tricky. [This IDD one works](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/185agmk/guide_how_to_setup_hdr_with_moonlightsunshine/)
		- Sunshine/Moonlight is compatible
- Use Windows shortcut keys to move windowed programs around `Win + Left/Right Keys`
- Use Windows shortcut keys to move fullscreen programs around `Shift + Win + Left/Right`
- SteamVR may still complain about Direct Display mode, but this can be safely ignored
- Exiting SteamVR will "restart" Steam - this is normal
- Overlays generally won't work on this virtual HMD
- Recommend using a XInput controller
- OpenXR games/mods seem to be more likely to work and be stable than OpenVR ones
- Optional HMD pitch and yaw emulation can be turned on to help with games or mods that need it (maps to XInput right stick)
	- The `ctrl_toggle_key` can be set and used to toggle these settings on/off in-game (only functions if `pitch_enable` and/or `yaw_enable` is set to true)
- HMD Height can be toggled between 0.1m and `hmd_height` using `Ctrl + F9`. This is useful for games that force a calibration on the "floor"
- HDR doesn't seem to work currently
- Several mods/games may override your settings
- DLSS, TAA, and other temporal based settings often create a halo around objects. UEVR has a halo fix that lets you use TAA, but others may not
- Depth and Convergence are saved to your `Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings` when you press `Ctrl+F7`. There are only global settings, no per-game ones.
- User Depth and Convergence Binds
	- The `num_user_settings` field must match the number of user defined configurations - as many as you want
	- Each configuration's Field Names should end with an integer, starting from 1
	- A Load key and a Store key can be configured to load and save Depth and Convergence settings for a configuration set
	- The Load key can be configured to `"switch"` to the user depth & convergence setting, `"toggle"` between the user and current every 1.5s, or `"hold"` the user setting until the key is released
	- The Store key will update your user Depth and Convergence setting to the current value
	- Changed values are saved to `Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings` if you press `Ctrl+F7`
	- If a User Depth and Convergence setting is in `Steam\config\steamvr.vrsettings` then it will override `Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\vrto3d\resources\settings\default.vrsettings`
